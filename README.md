# Phaser 3 TypeScript Games & Examples

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

This project contains all of the code for the Phaser 3 TypeScript projects and examples that I share on my YouTube channel here: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@swestover/featured)

Each sub project includes a `README.md` file that has more details on that particular project. Some of the information includes:

* how to setup and run that example/game
* links to the related videos on YouTube
* detailed links to the various code commits that include the starting and ending code versions
* and more!

You can find the live demos of the various examples here: [Examples](https://devshareacademy.github.io/phaser-3-typescript-games-and-examples/).
