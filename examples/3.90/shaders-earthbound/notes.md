 To resume this conversation, you would just need to provide a little context to get me back up to speed. Here is what you would need to provide:


   1. Set the context: Remind me of the project and our goal. You can start with something like:
      > "We are resuming our work on the Earthbound shaders project in Phaser. The current working directory is
  /Users/swestover/Documents/github/personal/phaser-3-typescript-games-and-examples/examples/3.90/shaders-earthbound."


   2. State our last action: Mention the last thing we did.
      > "We just finished creating the design document for the background scrolling shader."


   3. Give the next instruction: Tell me what you want to do next.
      > "Now, let's proceed with implementing the code for the background scrolling shader and pipeline."


  That's it. With that information, I'll have the full context and will be ready to pick up exactly where we left off.
